## Introduction <a name="intro"></a>

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

The main goal is to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. In that context this work intent to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. 

## Project Description <a name="descript"></a>

In this project, will be applied data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. There are some steps to complete this Udacity Project:
 - *Define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus*
 - *Write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL*
## Data <a name="data"></a>
#### Song Dataset  <a name="song"></a>

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are file paths to two files in this dataset.
> song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
> song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

> { "num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}

#### Log Dataset <a name="log"></a>

The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

> log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
> log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Project content <a name="content"></a>
There are 3 files `.py` and 2 python jupter notebooks `.ipynb`, the first three  are descripted below:

- `sql_queries.py`: here is all  DDL and DML queries used on this project
- `create_tables.py`: Execution of DDL queries
- `etl.py`: here is all process of data, get json files (raw data) > process them and insert into tables.

and the two notebooks:
- `etl.ipynb`: notebook test to build **etl** and **sql_query**  python scripts
- `test.ipynb`: Execution of test if all process is doing right

## Schema for Song Play Analysis  <a name="schema"></a>
Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

##### **Fact Table**  <a name="fact"></a>
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
-   **songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent**
##### **Dimension Tables**  <a name="dim"></a>

**users** - users in the app
-  ***user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level***

**songs** - songs in music database
-  ***song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration***

**artists** - artists in music database
- ***artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude***

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
-  ***start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday***

## How to  use  <a name="usage"></a>
#### Requirements  <a name="req"></a>
        - numpy==1.16.2
        - psycopg2==2.7.6.1
        - pandas==0.24.2
#### Execution  <a name="exec"></a>

For this step first you must to clone all repository and execute in that order, utilizing pyhthon in cmd `python create_tables.py` , `python etl.py`

After execution of these scripts you can use test.ipynb to run some tests and do Sanity Check of solution.

## Conclusion  <a name="end"></a>
In this project we have modeled  and create a star schema database in Postegres RDBMS from two different raw data sources in JSON format, in this process we apply the most common data engineering process: Extract, transform and load by inserting transformed data into the business significant tables that can be used in the analysis process.
